Project Title: Simulation of a Simple Physical System

Objective: Develop a Python program to simulate the motion of a simple physical system, such as a pendulum or a mass-spring system, using numerical methods.

How to Customize:

Replace the physical system model with one that aligns with your interests (e.g., a different type of mechanical system, a biological model, etc.).
Adjust the initial conditions, simulation parameters, and numerical integration method as needed.
This project demonstrates your ability to write Python code, use numerical methods for simulation, and visualize results. When presenting this project in your application, make sure to include a brief explanation of the chosen system, the numerical methods used, and any insights gained from the simulation.
